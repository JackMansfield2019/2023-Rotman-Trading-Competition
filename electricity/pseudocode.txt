grab latest news 
if the ticker==1 or 2 
    check for the intial forecast 
    if the headline has sunlight in it
        store range in Solar_Range : list
        Set estimated solar hours by adding upper and lower bound and dividing by two
        caclulate for ELEC-dayX contracts by multiplying the solar hours by 6
if the ticker==89 or 90 
    grab latest news 
    if the headline has sunlight in it
        if the lower bound > solar range[0]
            set lower bound = solar range[0] 
        if the upper bound < solar range[1]
            set upper bound = solar range[1]
        Calculate solar hours by adding solar range[0] and solar range[1] and dividing by 2
        Calculate estimated ELEC_dayx contracts by multiplying the solar hours by 6

if the ticker==149 or 150 
    grab latest news for price volume bulletin 
    grab -1 of that index news for final amount of sunlight 
    use that to calculate the final amount of ELEC-dayX
    Subtract the final amount from the variable ELEC
    Display the NG needed to be purchased by multiplying the ELEC variable by 40. 

if the ticker>=180
    grab latest news for price volume bulletin 
    if latest news had in headline price volume bulletin 2

if ticker == 149 or 150 
    grab latest news
    if latest news has in it headline price volume bulletin
        (Lower RAE + upper RAE)/2 = Average RAE
        if ARAE> ELEC-F
            buy as much ELEC-F
        if ARAE > NG
            buy and produce as much NG
		if holding NG 
			use that as well for production

Set lower tn  = 0 and upper tn  = 0, AT = 0 

if tick == 1 or 2 
    buy from the market the amount needed to sell, which is stored in the demand variable
    grab the first range of average temperatures and put this in list called Range_AT 
    variable At = (Range_AT[0] + RangeAT[1])/2
    Calculate demand through plugging AT into the formula 200-15AT + 0.8AT^2 - 0.01AT^3
if tick == 89 or 90 
    grab the second range
    if the lower bound > Range_AT[0]
        set lower bound = Range_AT[0] 
    if the upper bound < Range_AT[1]
        set upper bound = Range_AT[1]
    Calculate demand through plugging AT into the formula 200-15AT + 0.8AT^2 - 0.01AT^3

if tick == 149 or 150 
    calculate consumer demand using the exact AT scraped using 200-15AT + 0.8AT^2 - 0.01AT^3
    Store this in the variable demand

Trader
Check if there is a tender each tick
    if selling ELEC-F for > 70 per ELEC-F
        accept the tender
        Add amount of ELEC-F to the ELEC variable
        Add the amount to the debt variable
Check if owed > 0 each tick:
    check if trader bought any contract, if they did subtract from owed amount
    display owed amount if tick%10 == 0

if tick >= 180:
    owed = debt
    debt = 0
